        Welcome to my GitHub demo site! Here, I showcase what I've learned from a recent GitHub class, focusing on version control, collaboration, and project management using Git and GitHub. Throughout the course, I've gained proficiency in creating repositories, branching strategies, merging changes, handling pull requests, and utilizing GitHub's issue tracking and project management features effectively. This site serves as a testament to my newfound skills in leveraging GitHub for efficient and organized software development workflows. Feel free to explore and learn more about my journey in mastering GitHub!
